\noindent We are supposed to price a bond contract whose terminal condition is given by
%%% TERMINAL CONDITION OF THE BOND PRICE 
\begin{equation}
	V(S,T) = \max \left(F, RS\right).
\end{equation}

Moreover, the issuer of the bond pays out a continuous coupon at the rate of 
\begin{equation}
	K(t) = C \exp{-\alpha t},
\end{equation}
for $\alpha$ and $C$ of his choosing. The risk-neutral process followed by underlying stock price is given by
\begin{equation}
	\d S = \kappa \left(\theta(t)  - S\right)\d t + \sigma S^\beta \d W,
\end{equation}
with $\kappa$ being the mean reversion rate, $\beta$ the elasticity of variance in the market, and the function $\theta$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\theta(t) = (1+\mu)X\exp{\mu t},
\end{equation}
where $X$ and $\mu$ are constant model parameters that can be determined from the market, reflecting the dividend payout of the firm.

The market value $V(S,t)$ of this contract satisfies the following PDE
\begin{equation}\label{general_pde}
	\partial_t V + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^{2\beta}\partial_{SS}V + \kappa (\theta(t) - S)\partial_SV - rV + C\exp{-\alpha t} = 0,
\end{equation}
where its boundary conditions are given by
\begin{equation}\label{pde_S0}
	\partial_t V + \kappa \theta(t) \partial_S V - rV + C\exp{-\alpha t} = 0, \doublequad \text{ at } S= 0,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	V(S,t) = S A(t) + B(t), \doublequad \text{ as } S\to\infty,
\end{equation}
for $A$ and $B$ some functions to be derived.
